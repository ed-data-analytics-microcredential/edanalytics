<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we learn about R and help you set up your computer
to use R.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why R?</li>
<li>What can R do?</li>
<li>Install R on your computer</li>
<li>Install the RStudio IDE</li>
<li>Install the <code>tidyverse</code> R package</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-why-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Why R?</h2>
<p>R is a <em>free</em> and open-source programming language for
statistical computing and graphics. The R Project for Statistical
Computing (<a href="https://www.r-project.org"
class="uri">https://www.r-project.org</a>) supports and develops R.</p>
<p><strong>Why learn R?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>R is free and open-source. Because it is free, everyone has access
to it! Because it is open-source, anyone can add functionality to R in
the form of packages. Also, statisticians and computer scientist can can
audit the code and edit any bugs (i.e., there is no black box).</li>
<li>R is the <em>lingua franca</em> of statistics. In other words, it is
the most common data analysis tool. Since R is the main computing
environment for statistical analysis, both established and new methods
in statistics, data mining, machine learning, and psychometrics are
often employed using R, so there is no need for specialized software.
Just learn R and you are ready to go.</li>
<li>R has beautiful data visualization capabilities. We will learn the
basics of making graphs in R in this microcredential.</li>
<li>R has a great community! There are many talented R programmers that
have contributed helpful R packages. In addition, there are great R
mailing lists and Stack Overflow (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com"
class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com</a>) where you can find help using
R.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>R you ready?</strong></p>
<p>The R community is made up of people passionate about the
intersection of numbers, data, analysis, and code. It was invented by
scientists for statistical computing and a community of specialized
packages has been built around the language. In this first section, you
will be introduced to some basic R syntax and discuss how R classifies
data types so that it can mathematically process them in analysis.</p>
<p><em>Background Information:</em> Unlike with other programming
languages, most beginners who want to learn R do so because they want to
analyze data. In this way, R is more of a tool to understand data than a
programming language used to build software applications. However, what
we are learning will build the foundation for you to start programming
in R.</p>
<div id="section-what-can-r-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What Can R do?</h3>
<p><strong>Mathematical calculations.</strong> Let’s start with the
basic syntax for mathematical calculations in R. R performs addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division with +, -, *, and /
operators.</p>
<p>Run the following code using the blue “Run Code” button on the
right.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="math1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>573 - 74 + 1

25*2

10/5</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Mathematical operations in R follow the standard mathematical order
of operations. Let’s write your first line of R code and calculate some
basic math! Solve 3+10/2 by writing code below and pressing “Run Code”.
The answer should be 8 (i.e., 10/2 = 5 and 3+5 = 8). Remember with order
of operations division comes before addition. If you are not familiar
with the order of operation or need a refresher, click <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">here</a>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="math2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="math2-solution"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>3+10/2</code></pre>
</div>
<p><br> <strong>Comments.</strong> It’s often good practice to annotate
the code you write and not let the computer read it as code. We can
annotate or write text in our coding scripts using comments. Comments
are text written after a # in a program that is not run by the computer.
R interprets anything after a # as a comment. A brief example is
provided below demonstrating the use of comments.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="comment" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>12 + 21 #this line of code sums 12 and 21</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the sum of 12 and 21 is shown when you run the code,
but the comment is not displayed in the output.</p>
<p><strong>Data Types.</strong> Now that you know how to calculate basic
math and add comments explaining your code, let’s dive into how R
“thinks about” different types of data. In R and in programming in
general, data types are the classifications we give different pieces of
information. In this lesson, we will explore the following R data
types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numeric</strong>: Any number with or without a decimal
point: 23, -0.03 and the numeric null value <code>NA</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Character</strong>: Any grouping of characters on your
keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) or text. Most strings
are surrounded by single quotes: ’ … ’ or double quotes ” … “, though we
prefer single quotes. Sometimes you will hear this type referred to as
a”string”.</li>
<li><strong>Logical</strong>: This data type only has two possible
values— either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> (without quotes).
It’s helpful to think of logical types, or Boolean values, as on and off
switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.</li>
<li><strong>Factor</strong>: Used to represent groups or categories. R
internally stores factors as an integer with an associated label. We
will discuss factors in more detail later.</li>
<li><code>NA</code>: This data type represents the absence of a value,
and is represented by the keyword <code>NA</code> (without quotes) but
it has its own significance in the context of the different types. That
is there is a numeric NA, a character NA, and a logical NA. There is
also <code>NaN</code> which stands for “not a number”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variables and Objects.</strong> Now that you know how R
classifies some of the basic information types, we will almost always
want to ‘store’ this information as a variable or as an object. In
programming, variables allow us to store information and associate that
information with a name. In R, we assign objects and variables by using
the assignment operator, an arrow sign (&lt;-) made with a less-than
sign and a dash.</p>
<p>Below is an example demonstrating how to assign data types to a
variable or object. In this case, we are assigning a student ID number
to an object called <code>student_id</code>. Run the first line of code
written below. You can see that R gives no output. That’s because you
simply stored/assigned 98749 to the word <code>student_id</code>. Now go
ahead and type in <code>student_id</code> under the line of code
written. Take some time to think about the output R will give, if any at
all. Go ahead and run these two lines of code to show the output.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="assignmentoperator"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>student_id &lt;- 98749  #this assigns or &#39;stores&#39; 98749 (a numeric data type) to the object/variable named &#39;student_id&#39; </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><br> <strong>Vectors.</strong> In R, vectors are a list-like
structure that contain items of the same data type. To combine the list
of items to a vector, use the <code>c()</code> function and separate the
items by a comma. In the example below, we assign a list of character
data types (student ID numbers in this case) to a vector called
<code>student_ids</code>. Notice the use of the assignment operator
<code>&lt;-</code> and the <code>c()</code> function to create the
vector. <em>Note:</em> We could have made this a numeric vector by
removing the quotes <code>"</code> from around the numbers (e.g.,
<code>student_ids &lt;- c(98749, 042023, 052018, 061992)</code> ).</p>
<p>Like the example above, if you run the line of code written below, R
gives no output due to the same reason as above. Take some time to think
about the output R will give, if any at all, before typing in
<code>student_ids</code> under the line of code written and pressing
“Run Code.”</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectorassign"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>student_ids &lt;- c(&quot;98749&quot;, &quot;042023&quot;,&quot;052018&quot;,&quot;061992&quot;) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Try this yourself, create a character vector named
<code>first_quarter</code> and store the months “January”, “February”,
and “March” to the <code>first_quarter</code> vector.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="vectorassign2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":true,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="vectorassign2-hint-1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">

<div id="section-install-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Install R</h2>
<p>Great! Now that we know a little bit about R and what it can do,
let’s learn how to install the software onto your computer.</p>
<p>To be successful in this course, you will need to download and
install two required software programs on your computer: R and RStudio.
Don’t worry, both are free! The first software you will need to install
is R which the the <strong>programming language</strong> we will be
using in this course. R is available for multiple computer operating
systems such as Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. RStudio is the
<strong>software program</strong> that makes R (the programming
language) easy to use. As a recap, R is the programming language we will
be using and RStudio is the software program/environment we use R
in.</p>
<p>We will first cover how to install R, the programming language, then
we will cover how to install RStudio.</p>
<p>You can navigate to the official R and RStudio sites to download and
install: -<a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/">R</a> -<a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio</a>. Please

<h2>RStudio Tour</h2>
<p>Before we begin, please save the project file in Canvas titled

course materials for this class.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully saved the <code>.Rproj</code> file in your
preferred location on your computer. Double click on the
<code>.RProj</code> file to open up this file in RStudio (RStudio will
automatically open when you double click the file).</p>

<h2>Working Directory and R Projects</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoyed our virtual tour of RStudio. The next thing we
want to cover are working directories and R Projects. Both let RStudio
know where on your computer your saving your files or opening files
from. These are important to use and set up at the beginning when
creating R files/scripts (otherwise you will get errors messages because
RStudio doesn’t know what file location you’re working off of).</p>
<p>The video below will give you a brief tutorial of setting your file
location using a working directory or R Projects.</p>
<p>INSERT VIDEO LINK HERE FOR microcred- 1.1.02-getwd.mp4</p>
<p>You may have already figured out that you don’t need to use
<code>getwd()</code> for the <code>intro to R</code> file you’re using
in RStudio right now since it’s part of an R Project. Using R Projects
can be advantageous since RStudio recognizes the location of all the
files stored within an R Project.</p>
<p>We will dig into more detail on R projects in the 1.2 Foundational
Skills module.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>
