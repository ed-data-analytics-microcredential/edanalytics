<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome back to the final module of this mini course. In the previous
module we learned how to <strong>transform</strong>,
<strong>tidy</strong>, and <strong>visualize</strong> data using the
<code>tidyverse</code> package.</p>
<p>In this course we learned how to <strong>import</strong>,
<strong>wrangle</strong>, and <strong>visualize</strong> our data. In
this final module, we will learn how to generate basic descriptive
statistics.</p>
<p><img src="images/base.png" width="75%" /></p>
<p>Before jumping into descriptive statistics functions in R, we want to
first introduce and review the following foundational statistics
terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population vs. Sample</li>
<li>Parameter vs. Statistic</li>
<li>Dependent and independent variables</li>
<li>Levels of measurement</li>
<li>Types of data</li>
<li>Randomization</li>
<li>Internal vs. External validity</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know where we’ve been and where we’re headed, let’s go
ahead and jump into it!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-population-vs.-sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Population vs. Sample</h2>
<p>The difference between a population and sample is one of the first
concepts taught in statistics and research methods courses. A
<strong>population</strong> is the complete group you want to make
conclusions about and a <strong>sample</strong> is a subset of the
population you’re interested in. Researchers often collect data from a
sample to make conclusions (or draw inferences) about the entire
population of interest.</p>
<p><img src="images/population.png" width="75%" /></p>
<p>For example, all undergraduate students at the University of
Tennessee (UT) would be considered the entire undergraduate population
of UT. However, a random selection of 200 undergraduate students from UT
would be considered a sample of the population.</p>
<p>Now that we know the difference between a population and a sample, we
can discuss the difference between a parameter and a statistic.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-parameter-vs.-statistic" class="section level2">
<h2>Parameter vs. Statistic</h2>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong> are numbers that describe the properties
of an entire population and <strong>statistics</strong> are numbers that
describe the properties of a sample.</p>
<p>Let’s turn back to our example of undergraduate students at UT. In <a
href="https://irsa.utk.edu/reporting/fact-book/">Fall 2022</a>, 27,039
undergraduate students were enrolled at UT which represents the entire
undergraduate population at UT. Let’s say we have the average age of all
27,039 undergraduate students and the average age is 22 years old. The
average age of the entire undegraduate student body at UT would be
considered a parameter as it describes the average age of a population
of interest. Let’s say we didn’t have access to the age of all 27,039
undergraduate students but collected a sample of 200 students and asked
how old they were. We averaged the age of the 200 student sample and
found the average age of this sample to be 21 years old. The average age
of this sample would be considered a statistic as it describes a
properties of a sample of interest.</p>
<p>In most research cases, it is difficult to collect data for an entire
population so we instead take a sample in which we can make inferences
about the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-independent-and-dependent-variables"
class="section level2">
<h2>Independent and Dependent Variables</h2>
<p>Researchers often examine relationships between variables in a sample
of interest. Variables are characteristics of interest in a sample or
population that can take on different values. For example, variables can
be height, age, test scores, etc.</p>
<div id="section-independent-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Independent Variable</h3>
<p>Researchers want to examine relationship between variables as guided
by their specific research question. This examination is done by
specifying an independent variable and a dependent variable. An
<strong>independent variable</strong> is a variable that varies or can
be manipulated to explore the effect or relationship it has with a
<strong>dependent variable</strong>. As the name implies, independent
variables are variables that are independent of other
variables/characteristics. Meaning that no other variables in the
research study impact the independent variable.</p>
<p>Independent variables can be experimental, that is directly
manipulated by the researcher (e.g., treatment conditions in an
experiment), or naturally occurring characteristics of a subject such as
height, weight, education, age.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-dependent-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Dependent Variable</h3>
<p>A <strong>dependent variable</strong>, also called the <em>outcome
variable</em>, is hypothesized to change as a result of changing or
manipulating the <strong>independent variable</strong>. In other words,
the dependent variable’s changes are contingent upon the independent
variable. The dependent variable is the outcome of interest. A
researcher aims to examine how the dependent variable changes as the
independent is manipulated or varied.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>A classic example of independent and dependent variables is examining
the relationship between students’ study hours and their test score. In
other words, if students study more, do their test scores increase? If a
researcher wishes to examine the relationship between study hours and
test performance, the independent variable would be study hours and the
dependent (or outcome) variable would be test scores.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-levels-of-measurement" class="section level2">
<h2>Levels of Measurement</h2>
<p>In statistics, variables can be quantified based four levels of
measurement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominal</li>
<li>Ordinal</li>
<li>Interval</li>
<li>Ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>The levels of measurement are listed in ascending order, starting
with nominal variables, based on the progressively detailed information
they provide.</p>
<div id="section-nominal-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Nominal Variables</h3>
<p>Nominal variables are names of categories data can fall in. An easy
way to remember what nominal variables are is to think nominal = names.
For example, students’ major can be considered a nominal variable in a
dataset with postsecondary student data (e.g., accounting major,
statistics major, education major).</p>
<p>Nominal variables do have a countable number of distinct groups so
they cannot be unknown to the researcher or infinite. While nominal
variables have a countable number of named categories, they don’t have a
natural order. Going back to our example of students’ major, there is
not natural order of accounting, statistics, or education majors as
categories. Statistics is greater, equal, or less than the other
majors.</p>
<p>Other examples of nominal variables can be gender, race/ethnicity,
college minors.</p>
<p>Binary variables (also called dichotomous variables) are a type of
nominal variables which can only have two distinct values. Examples of
binary variables are male/female, pass/fail, control/treatment.</p>
<p>Since you can’t calculate the mean, median, or standard deviation of
nominal variables, the mode is the proper measure of central tendenct
for nominal variables as you can identify the most common occuring
category in a dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-ordinal-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Ordinal Variables</h3>
<p>Ordinal variables are similar to nominal variables since they too
have categories of data, however, they are different, and provide more
information than nominal variables, since ordinal variables can be
ranked following a natural order of values.</p>
<p>Example of ordinal variables are education levels (primary,
secondary, post-secondary), income (low, middle, hight), class rank.</p>
<p>While ordinal variables can be ranked, we don’t know the exact
degrees of difference between these categories. Let’s take class rank
for example. Person A might have a class rank of 10, Person B a class
rank of 11, and Person C a class rank of 12. While we know the rank of
these individuals, we don’t know the relative absolute different between
these individuals. For example, Person A might have a GPA of 3.978,
Person B a 3.969 GPA, and Person C a 3.900 GPA. While they’re class rank
is ordered, they don’t have the same distance apart from each other in
terms of GPA which is why we rank them if we don’t know the relative
degrees of difference between them.</p>
<p>Calculating the median is a valid measure of central tendency for
ordinal variables since the median is the middle ranked value which is
fitting for rank-order data.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interval-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Interval Variables</h3>
<p>The next most descriptive level of measurement are variables measured
on an interval scale. Interval scales are used for data that’s
continuous without a true zero. For example, SAT scores are measured on
an interval scale where the distance between two points is meaningful
(unlike ordinal variables) since we know the relative degrees of
difference between these two points. However, SAT scores don’t have a
true zero point (even if you answered every question on the SAT
incorrectly, you wouldn’t receive a 0).</p>
<p>With interval scales, we can calculate the mean and standard
deviation to determine central tendency and measure of variation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-ratio-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Ratio Variables</h3>
<p>The most descriptive level of measurement are ratio variables. Like
interval variables, ratio variables are also used for continuous data,
but are different for having a true zero measurement which represents a
lack of an attibute. For example, height, weight, speed, and time are
all ratio variables as they have true zero measurements which represents
no height, weight, speed, or time.</p>
<p>Ratio variables are the top level of measurement as you can order the
observations, know the difference between any two values, and be able to
assess ratios between values as they have a true zero measurement</p>
<p>You can calculate and assess frequency distributions, medians, means,
standard deviations, and ratios with ratio variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-types-of-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Types of Data</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve started discussing the different scales our data can
be measured on, let’s talk more about the different types of data we
will encounter in the education research field.</p>
<div id="section-qualitative-and-quantitative-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>Qualitative and Quantitative Data</h3>
<p>In the education research field, you will hear a lot about
qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
<div id="section-qualitative-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Qualitative data</h4>
<p>Qualitative data is typically collected through interviews, focus
groups, document analysis, and text analysis and is used to understand
the context, nuances, and themes of a research context. It’s often
represented and analyzed through text (including text from audio
transcriptions) to describe a research phenomenon. Ultimately,
qualitative data is non-numeric and cannot be counted, measured, or
easily expressed through the use of numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-quantitative-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Quantitative data</h4>
<p>On the other hand, quantitative data quantifies a research phenomenon
through data that can be measured and counted through the use of
numbers. Quantitative data can be collected through any means in which
you can count or measure data (e.g., surveys, administrative data,
observations, etc.). Quantitative data is used to establish
generalization about a sample for to a larger population by testing
theories and assumptions using statistics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-discrete-continuous-and-categorical-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>Discrete, Continuous, and Categorical Data</h3>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative data can often be represented through
discrete, continuous, and categorical data types.</p>
<div id="section-discrete-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Discrete data</h4>
<p>Discrete data is a numeric variable is considered a quantitative data
type as it represented by integers. Discrete data can be counted which
can only take on specific values (which are infinite). For example, you
can count the number of students that enter a classroom but they will
only be represented through whole numbers, meaning you can’t have 24.5
students in a classroom.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-continuous-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Continuous data</h4>
<p>Continuous data is also a numeric variable that is considered a
quantitative data type that can be represented with decimal values or
fractions. Continuous data can also have finite or infinite number of
values. For example, student’s GPA would be considered as continuous
data as it has meaningful decimal places. While discrete data is used to
be counted, continuous data is used to measure a data point using a
predetermined scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-categorical-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Categorical data</h4>
<p>Categorical data is data represented by a finite number of groups.
It’s typically considered a qualitative data type as the data can be
stored and grouped into categories rater than being measured
numerically. However, categorical data can be counted and represented as
discrete data. Examples of categorical data include typical demographic
variables such as race/ethnicity, sex, educational attainment,
socioeconomic status.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-randomization" class="section level2">
<h2>Randomization</h2>
<p>Randomization techniques are often used in research settings in
efforts to achieve a research design which mitigates biases and
strengthens internal or external validity (more on this in the next
section). There are two primary ways randomization occurs: 1) Random
selection and 2) Random assignment.</p>
<div id="section-random-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>Random Selection</h3>
<p>Random selection is also known as random sampling and is a technique
used to randomly select members of a population to be used as the
study’s sample. There are four common types of random selection
techniques that are used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple random sampling</strong>: Each member of a
population has an equal and fair probability of being selected. This is
one of the most convenience and simple random selection
techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systematic sampling</strong>: The selection criteria
follows a predetermined interval (k) to determine the members of a
population that will be selected. For example, every 12th person in list
of alphabetized last names will be selected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stratified sampling</strong>: This technique first
divides the population into subgroups with notable distinctions as
predetermined by a researcher. For example, a researcher might want to
interview teachers across the U.S. If the researcher has a list of
teachers within all schools, the researcher can divide and categorize
the schools by geographic urbanality (e.g., rural, suburban, urban) and
then randomly teachers a specific number of teachers within each school.
This technique allows researchers to ensure respective subgroups are
adequately represented in the sample (creating a representative sample
of teachers in the US).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster sampling</strong>: This technique is similar to
stratified sampling but instead it includes all members of a subgroup
instead of randomly selected members inside of a subgroup.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-random-assignment" class="section level3">
<h3>Random Assignment</h3>
<p>Random assignment is a randomization technique used to assign
individuals into experimental conditions. In the simplest design of an
experimental study, you will have a treatment and a control group. In
order to ensure there are no systematic differences of individuals
between the treatment and control group, you will randomly assign
participants to each group. Random assignment is the hallmark of a
“true” experiment since any differences found between the treatment and
control group are attributed to the treatment or intervention.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-internal-vs.-external-validity" class="section level2">
<h2>Internal vs. External Validity</h2>
<p>The final concept we will cover is on study validity which can be
assessed through internal and external validity.</p>
<div id="section-internal-validity" class="section level3">
<h3>Internal Validity</h3>
<p>Internal validity is in reference to an experimental study’s design
and methods. Internal validity is assessed through the controlling and
accounting for confounding variables. Strong internal validity allows
you have have confidence that your results of an experiment are caused
by only one independent variable (the treatment or intervention). Random
sampling is one way to establish strong internal validity for
experimental designs.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-external-validity" class="section level3">
<h3>External Validity</h3>
<p>External validity references how your results can be generalized to
the population beyond the sample used in your study. In other words, can
the results from the study be generalized to the real world? External
validity does not assess causality or ruling out confounding variables.
There are two types of external validity to consider: 1) population
validity and 2) ecological validity.</p>
<p>Population validity considers how well your sample represents the
population under study. A random sampling technique can establish
population validity if used appropriately. Ecological validity considers
how similar the study setting and the real-world setting are to each
other. One method of assessing ecological validity is replicating the
study at a different time, in a different setting, with different
participants to assess if similar results are obtained.</p>
